Since late 2016 I have been working full remote from Vigo, my hometown, where we settle a new team, visiting Barcelona and Amsterdam a few times per year. I work on the development of new application as of maintaining already existing ones and giving support to customers. More recently I focus on defining the strategies to migrate to Azure and the architectural changes needed, this lead to many challenges which were very interesting and help me to improve my Azure skills. We focused on a monolitic to micro services migration for many components and best use of the solutions available on cloud.\nThe lead developer role included among my duties check the CV of the applicants and be part of the hiring process, afterwards, giving training and advice when needed, also I introduced many changes in the development process such as improving the devops platform, creating a code analysis system and proposing changes to the source control platform and development workflow. I also assist the sales department on visits to customers explaining our solutions and looking the best way to help them using our expertise.\n"

Besides of that, I took care of the Continuous Integration process, migrating from CruiseControl.Net to Teamcity, building the build & deploy scripts needed to manage different branches and servers. This work lead to significant savings in the deploying times, what help us to reduce gaps between servers. As result I participate supporting the implantation of Teamcity for the whole PSA-Peugeot Citroen group. One of the most interesting skills I acquired was LINQ, which allow me to create better code in terms of performance and faster development and allow me to introduce this technology to coworkers. Also, part of my tasks was to refactor the application according to newer .NET Frameworks and tools such as REST and Web Services, AJAX, jQuery and NUnit. Finally, I was in charge of mentoring new roles about development process and introducing new technologies to team members, besides of being the reference for the most difficult tasks."
