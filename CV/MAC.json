Since late 2016 I have been working full remote from Vigo, my hometown, where we settle a new team, visiting Barcelona and Amsterdam a few times per year. I work on the development of new application as of maintaining already existing ones and giving support to customers. More recently I focus on defining the strategies to migrate to Azure and the architectural changes needed, this lead to many challenges which were very interesting and help me to improve my Azure skills. We focused on a monolitic to micro services migration for many components and best use of the solutions available on cloud.\nThe lead developer role included among my duties check the CV of the applicants and be part of the hiring process, afterwards, giving training and advice when needed, also I introduced many changes in the development process such as improving the devops platform, creating a code analysis system and proposing changes to the source control platform and development workflow. I also assist the sales department on visits to customers explaining our solutions and looking the best way to help them using our expertise.\n"

Besides of that, I took care of the Continuous Integration process, migrating from CruiseControl.Net to Teamcity, building the build & deploy scripts needed to manage different branches and servers. This work lead to significant savings in the deploying times, what help us to reduce gaps between servers. As result I participate supporting the implantation of Teamcity for the whole PSA-Peugeot Citroen group. One of the most interesting skills I acquired was LINQ, which allow me to create better code in terms of performance and faster development and allow me to introduce this technology to coworkers. Also, part of my tasks was to refactor the application according to newer .NET Frameworks and tools such as REST and Web Services, AJAX, jQuery and NUnit. Finally, I was in charge of mentoring new roles about development process and introducing new technologies to team members, besides of being the reference for the most difficult tasks."

These assignments helped me to improve my communication skills. The first project, for GE Artesia Bank, consisted on the migration from DTS to SSIS, introducing SSRS, the creation of the necessary datamarts, ETL processes and also the development of an internal management system and related tools. This assignment began with 3 months in Amsterdam and continuing 9 months from Spain, involving the following technologies: C#, ASP.NET, Winforms, SQL Server and as mentioned Reporting and Integration Services from Microsoft.\nThe second project was a legacy application support for industrial business. The project required 1 month in Allentown, Pennsylvania and afterwards 3 months of support from Spain during USA business hours. The goal of this project was to take care of and old 4th generation language (Magic) and support the application during its shutdown. The last project consisted of producing and analysing business intelligence reports for the credit risk department of GE, spotting loading errors or significant differences at business level. During this project I had to travel to Paris several times. I was the team leader in the final phase of the project in Paris. Between assignments I worked on internal applications development and IT costs analysis what lead to important savings.\n"
